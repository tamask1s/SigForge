== What is SigForge

SigForge is scriptable data viewing, data acquisition, and digital signal processing application, running under Windows OS.

image:res/SigForge2.png[SigForge]

The data representations are 2 dimensional data sets, typical to multichannel biological data.

The signal processing algorithms can be executed by running Data Browser scripts.

SigForge is extendible with customized data processing algorithms, and data acquisition modules. This is achieved by SigForge's plugin-based architecture. In order to use new plugins, those needs to be copied in the proper plugin directories. For more information on developing plugins, please check link:../../devDoc/devDoc.html[SigForge's developer guide].

SigForge's data engine is also a plugin, which can be used for automation, or can be included into customized applications, allowing one to use the scripts developed in SigForge to run in a specially tailored environment. For more information on this topic, please check SigForge's developer guide.

== SigForge's menu

File, Edit, Window, Options, Tools, Help

=== File Menu

.Fhe Following are implemented:
* "Open data file": opens a data file. Supported formats are:
** EDF (Europian data format)
** BDF (Biosemi data format)
** DAT (DADiSP data format)
* "New script window": opens a new <<script_window, script editor window>>

=== Edit Menu

Not implemented.

.Works as a classical Windows OS MDI (Multi document interface) menu, letting the user to
* switch between wopened windows,
* tile them horizontally,
* tile vertically,
* cascade them.

=== Options, Tools, Help Menus

Not implemented.

[[DataTypes]]
== SigForge data providers

.SigForge can have its data from its data providers. These can be:
* Data File codecs, supporting the following file types: EDF, BDF or DADiSP dat files. This type of provider opens the file, and makes its whole content available at once.

|===
|DATA FILE CODEC |EXTENSION |USE IN SCRIPTS

|EDF
|.edf; .edfp
|1

|BDF
|.bdf
|4

|DADiSP
|.dat
|3

|===

* Data Acquisition devices. In this case, the data is streaming, it is arriving continuously, and the resulting data is growing in size as the time passes.

== SigForge scripting

SigForge has a basic scripting language working with SigForge's data representations.

The scripting supports function calls only, operators are not supported.

=== Data representation

.SigForge has 2 types of data
* data opened and visualized by display windows are persistent: they survive script runs. They are called 'data'.
* while running a script, data imported in a script running context are ephemeral: they lives only during script runs. They are called 'variable'.

All 'data' objects are stored in a data list, while all 'variables' are stored in a variable list, and are accessable only from scripts. These lists are global objects. All data in the data list is displayed in SigForge's windows, and all variables in the variable list are living only during a script call, then the variable list is cleared.

'Variables' from the variable list can be *moved* into the data list by displaying them (calling the <<DisplayData, DisplayData>> function).

'Data' objects can be imported, *copied* into the variable list during a script run by calling the <<DataIn, DataIn>> function.

The script may change that variable, and it may display it. If it is displayed, it means that it is moved back to the data list. In this case it overwrites the data with the same name relyig in the specific display window.

If a variable was not displayed, it will be deleted as the script ends.

As a result all persistent data can be seen in windows, and no invisble memory leak can be produced in this level.

.Data and variable both have the following properties:
* name
* number of channels
* horizontal units (usually sec(s))
* vertical units (a value for each channel, example mV, 1/s(Hz), etc.)
* number of samples (a value for each channel)
* sampling rates (a value for each channel)

=== Script types

.Once we press the "Run" button on the <<script_window, script editor window>>, SigForge will run the script in that window. The script may
* finish completely after its last function returns
* or it may trigger an interval, which will re-run a portion of the script periodically. See Interval() function. The variables living in a script running context will not outlive the interval's execution end, therefore any information needed to be available for re-entering intervals, needs to be persisted in a 'data', usually called as *history* 'data'.

=== Function types

.Functions may work with
* 'data'
* 'variable'
* both 'data' and 'variable'

.Functions may be 'simple', or 'real-time'.
* Simple functions are working on whole or specified parts of a 'data' or 'variable'
* Real time (RT) functions are working with 'data' provided by data acquisition devices, which are continuously growing in size. They are intended to process only the newly arrived data chunks. In order to do this, they need a *history* 'data' as a parameter, in order to persist the information needed for the signal processing (at least the last position of the processing, but possibly more). They are working usually with 'data' parameters, but not necessarily. RT functions are marked with the '_RT' characters.

While RT functions are just simple functions with a *history* 'data' parameter, in any other aspect they are the same, and they are distinguished by their intended usage only, this categorization is important because only RT functions can process effectively streamed data.

=== Syntax

Basic function call:

-----

function1(param1, param2, ...);

-----

Most functions are working with variables or data 'parameters', without a return value, but some functions may return plain text results.

-----

function1(function2(param1, ...), param2, ...);

-----

Some functions may have a body:

-----

function1(...)
{
    function2(...)
};

This may be useful if a block needs to be executed multiple times (loop), or after a timeout, or periodically (interval).
Note that in the basic case the script is not reaching its end, therefore all the variables created till the execution of the block will be available, while in case of a timeout or an interval the variable list will be cleaned before the execution reaches the block.
As a result, all timeouts and intervals are starting with a clean context (empty variable list).

-----

All the parameters are plain text strings, only the actual function decides how to interpret them.


The parameters are separated by commas.

There is a maximum number of 8 parameters. Therefore some functions may interpret one single parameter as 2 real parameters, like param2 and param3 in the example bellow:

-----

function1(param1, param2 param3, param4, ...);

-----


[[script_window]]
=== Script editor window

SigForges’s script editor is a text editor with a basic syntax highlight.

image:res/scripting_window.gif[Scripting window]

== *Scripting functions delivered with SigForge and its basic signal processing plugins*

SigForge comes with a basic set of digital signal processing and helper functions:

// Template for a script in the userDoc
//[[ScriptName]]
//=== ScriptName
//
//_In progress_
// Works with 'data/variable'. Description of the given script
//
//Syntax: 'here put the script syntax'
//
//.'Parameters'
//
//* 'first param': the description of the parameter
//* 'second param': the description of the parameter...
//
//.'Returns'
//* Here is the return value


[[DisplayData]]
=== DisplayData

Works with 'variable' and 'data'. Moves the specified variable from the variable list into the data list, and displays its content in a display window jus as a data file would be opened.

Syntax: 'DisplayData([var_name], [fit_width], [display_type], [offset_setting], [other_setting])'

.'Parameters'

* 'var_name': the variable name what we want to display in a display window.
* 'fit_width': optional. Defaulted to false. Set to "true" or "fit_width" will fit all the data into the window.
* 'display_type': optional. Defaulted to basic multiline display ("multiline"). It can have the following other values:
** 'multiline': data is displayed as multiple series of lines
** '2D_map': data is displayed as a heatmap
** '2D_map_surface': data is displayed as a heatmap with map contour lines
** 'value_list': data is displayed in a table of values
* 'offset_setting': optional. Defaulted to ("A1"). It can have the following other values:
** 'N': no extra offsets are set, only fixed offsets to all channels proportional to their channel index.
** 'A1': offsets are approximated for all channels with algorithm 1 to fit into screen one channel after another.
** 'A2': offsets are approximated for all channels with algorithm 2 to fit into screen one channel after another.
** 'B': the zero coordinate is set to be at the bottom of the 'y' axis for all the channels. Useful for spectrums.
** 'C': the zero coordinate is set to the middle of the 'y' axis.
* 'other_setting': optional. Defaulted to display without grids, using antialiased lines with width 1. It is a 4 digit setting, the first digit standing for the horizontal, whilest the second for the vertical grid behaviour. The third stands for line drawing style, and the fourth for the line width.
** first 2 digits:
*** '0' no grid are displayed
*** '1' major grids are displayed only
*** '2' both major and minor grids are displayed
** 3rd digit:
*** '0' antialiased (default)
*** '1' normal line
** 4th digit: line width in pixels

Note: Horizontal grids can only be displayed in the cases when all the channels have a common 'y' axis. This may be the case if only one channel is displayed, or either the 'B' or 'C' offset settings are used.

==== Data display's features

image:res/DisplayData01.png[Displaying spectrum]

Note: heatmap views are working slowly if the data has thousands of channels (rows).

==== Data display's 'Settings' window

Visible channels can be set up by using the 'Settings' window of the display window. Additional information is also accessible here:

* channel labels
* horizontal units
* vertical units
* data length

image:res/SettingsWindow.gif[Settings window]

In the abouve settings window the visible channels of a data with 2 channels can be set. The data has no labels. Vertical units are in 'mV', the sampling rate is '1000 Samples per second', and the data length is '10 seconds'.

==== Data display's relative scaling of 'y' axis

image:res/RelativeScaling.png[Settings window]

By clicking the bar on the left of the display window, a panel with sliders can be shown. By adjusting the sliders, a relative scaling of the 'y' axis of the corresponding channel can be achieved.

==== DisplayData's window management functions

Syntax: 'DisplayData(manage_windows, [managing_action], [target_window])'

.'Parameters'

* 'managing_action': can have the following values:
** tile_horizontally
** tile_vertically
** cascade
** maximize
* 'target_window': optional. In case of 'maximize', the window which needs to be maximized

==== DisplayData's scaling functions

Syntax: 'DisplayData(scale_window, [scaling_action], [target_window])'

.'Parameters'

* 'scaling_action': can have the following values:
** horzontally_in: scales the 'x' axis in
** horzontally_out: scales the 'x' axis out
** reset_horzontal: resets the scaling to default for x axis.
* 'target_window': the window which going to be scaled

Note: scaling actions are cumulating. If you keep a window opened, then running a script multiple times will scale your window more and more. You need to reset the scaling if you want to avoid the cumulative effect.

Works with 'variable'. The function will determine the difference between the sampling frequencies of the long and short signals and modify the peaks variable. The peaks variable will contain the same peaks but on the smaller sampling frequency. Peaks are signaled with 1 while the non-peak samples are signaled with 0.

Syntax: 'DownsamplePeaks([long_var_name, short_var_name, peaks_var_name])'

.'Parameters'

* 'long_var_name': the name of the variable containing the signal with the bigger sampling frequency.
* 'short_var_name': the name of the variable containing the signal with the smaller sampling frequency.
* 'peaks_var_name': the name of the input variable containing the peaks to downsample.

.'Returns'
* -


[[CreateMotherSignal]]
=== CreateMotherSignal

Works with 'variable'. The function will create the mother signal from each channel of the input variable. It will create a matrix containing the QRS complexes defined in the peaks variable. Singular value decomposition will be performed in this matrix. The 3 strongest singular values will be kept, the others will be evaluated before rebuilding the signal. With this, the fetal peaks and the noises will be removed, and only the mother signal will remain.

Syntax: 'CreateMotherSignal([src_var_name, peaks_var_name, out_var_name])'

.'Parameters'

* 'src_var_name': the name of the input variable containing the signal.
* 'peaks_var_name': the name of the peaks variable containing the maternal peaks detected on the signal.
* 'out_var_name': the name of the output variable.

.'Returns'
* -

[[QrsFDetection]]
=== QrsFDetection

Works with 'variable'. The function will detect the fetal peaks on each channels of the input variable. The input signal should contain only the fetal QRS complexes, without the mother QRS complexes. 

Syntax: 'QrsFDetection([src_var_name, maternal_peaks_var_name, out_var_name])'

.'Parameters'

* 'src_var_name': the name of the input variable containing the signal.
* 'maternal_peaks_var_name': the name of the peaks variable containing the maternal peaks detected on the signal.
* 'out_var_name': the name of the output variable containing the fetal peaks.

.'Returns'
* -

[[SelectBestFChannel]]
=== SelectBestFChannel

Works with 'variable'. The function will select the best channel from the fetal peaks variable. The peaks are signalled with 1, while the non-peak samples are 0.

Syntax: 'SelectBestFChannel([fetal_peaks_var_name, maternal_peaks_var_name, out_var_name])'

.'Parameters'

* 'fetal_peaks_var_name': the name of the peaks variable containing the fetal peaks.
* 'maternal_peaks_var_name': the name of the peaks variable containing the maternal peaks.
* 'out_var_name': the name of the output variable containing the chosen fetal peaks channel.

.'Returns'
* -

[[CreateRandomVec]]
=== CreateRandomVec

Works with 'variable'. The function will create a variable. The variable will have 1 channel, with 'vec_length' number of values randomly choosen from the ['min_value', 'max_value') interval, using uniform distribution.

Syntax: 'CreateRandomVec([out_var_name, vec_length, min_value, max_value])'

.'Parameters'

* 'out_var_name': the name of the output variable containing the random vector.
* 'vec_length': the length of the random vector.
* 'min_value': minimum random value.
* 'max_value': maximum random value.


.'Returns'
* -
